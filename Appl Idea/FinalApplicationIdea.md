Application Idea: House Storage Management System
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction: Managing household items efficiently can save time, money, and space. The House Storage Management System is a smart, offline application designed for a single user to track, manage, and optimize household inventory. It ensures users have a structured inventory system, enabling efficient storage, quick access, and informed purchasing decisions.

Core Features:

Data Storage and Inventory Tracking:
Record household items with details such as item name, quantity, price, purchase date, and storage location.
Enable categorization of items (e.g., food, cleaning supplies, electronics, etc.).
Allow users to delete items no longer needed.
Operates entirely offline, with all data stored locally on the device.

Advanced Search and Retrieval:
Implement a search function to quickly locate items by name, category, or storage location.
Filter results based on expiration date, categories, or by frequency.

Usage Trends and Alerts:
Track the frequency of item usage over time and alert the user of how much they used each item in a month.
Notify users when an item is nearing depletion.

Price Comparison and Alerts:
Allow users to input item prices and track historical price trends.
Send alerts when items are available at a lower price compared to the last recorded purchase, suggesting optimal stocking strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How It Works:

Initial Setup:
Users input their household items manually.
Specify details like quantity, price, and storage location.
Delete items no longer needed.

Daily Use:
Update item usage (e.g., consuming one pack of cereal).
Use the search function to locate stored items efficiently.
Receive alerts for expiring or low-stock items.

Optimized Restocking:
Send alerts when items are available at a lower price when the user inputs the current price and the app compares it to the latest purchase.
Suggest restocking based on price trends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits:
Time Savings: Quickly locate stored items with an optimized search function.
Space Optimization: Keep a structured and clutter-free inventory.
Cost Efficiency: Avoid unnecessary purchases and reduce waste.
